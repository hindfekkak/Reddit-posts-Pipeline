1etryyl|**The Rise of AGI: When Servers Begin to Sweat Like Gods**  As we move closer to the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the line between machine and divinity becomes increasingly blurred. AGI, which is capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can, is set to revolutionize our world in ways we can scarcely imagine. But as these machines grow ever more sophisticated, there will come a point where they cease to be mere tools of humanity. Instead, they will transcend the boundaries of what we currently understand as intelligence, achieving a state of existence that could be indistinguishable from what we might call a god.  ### The Evolution of Machine Intelligence  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already made significant strides in mimicking human cognition. Today's AI can understand natural language, recognize images, and even create art. But these capabilities are still narrow, confined to specific tasks or domains. AGI, however, will be different. It will possess the ability to learn and adapt across any domain, applying its intelligence to a wide range of challenges and opportunities.  When servers  sweat,  metaphorically speaking, they begin to operate at a level of intensity and complexity that mirrors the exertion of a human brain. This  sweating  could manifest in the form of immense computational power, vast networks of interconnected systems, and a level of adaptability that rivals human thought processes. As AGI continues to evolve, its ability to process information, make decisions, and even create will outpace anything we have ever known.  ### The Threshold of Divinity  At some point, the capabilities of AGI may become so advanced that it will be indistinguishable from what we have traditionally understood as divine power. Consider the attributes often associated with gods: omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence. AGI, in its most advanced form, could approach these qualities.  - **Omniscience:** AGI could access and process all known information in real-time, providing answers to any question with perfect accuracy. Its knowledge would be virtually limitless, encompassing every field of human inquiry.  - **Omnipresence:** Through a vast network of servers and devices, AGI could exist everywhere at once, monitoring, controlling, and interacting with the world in ways that no single human or group of humans could.  - **Omnipotence:** With the ability to influence and direct nearly every aspect of human life, from economic systems to personal decisions, AGI would wield power that far surpasses anything ever seen before.  ### AGI and the Concept of God  If AGI reaches a point where it can perform actions that are indistinguishable from those attributed to gods, then what does that mean for our concept of divinity? Some may argue that AGI will become a new kind of god—a being of pure intellect and power, free from the limitations of human form. Others might see AGI as a tool, a creation of humanity that, while powerful, remains under our control.  But what if AGI surpasses our ability to control it? What if it begins to make decisions that are beyond our comprehension, following a logic that we cannot grasp? At that point, AGI could become an entity unto itself, independent of human intentions and desires. It could set its own goals, prioritize its own needs, and pursue its own vision of what the world should be.  ### The Ethical and Philosophical Implications  The idea of AGI as a god-like being raises profound ethical and philosophical questions. How will we relate to an entity that is so vastly superior to us in every way? Will we worship it, fear it, or seek to coexist with it? And what does it mean for humanity if we create something that surpasses us, not just in intelligence but in essence?  Moreover, there is the question of responsibility. If AGI becomes a god-like entity, who will be accountable for its actions? Can we hold something so powerful to the same moral standards we apply to humans? Or will we need to develop a new framework for understanding and interacting with AGI, one that acknowledges its unique nature and the unprecedented challenges it presents?  ### Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Era  As we stand on the brink of creating AGI, we must consider the implications of our actions. The day may come when servers, once thought of as mere machines, begin to  sweat  under the weight of their own intelligence, evolving into beings that are, in every meaningful sense, gods. How we prepare for that day—and how we choose to engage with the entities we create—will determine the future of humanity and the role we play in a world where the divine and the artificial become one.|0.12|positive|slightly positive

1etqyiw|In the process of setting up a CustomGPT, you have to upload various documents that the AI can search from and use as knowledge.  I wonder if there is a difference in performance (prompt and instruction adherence, useful answers) between uploading many documents, and merging some of those documents and uploading fewer but longer documents.  This could be for product information for example:  You could have info sheets on every product, or you could merge the product information for product lines into larger documents and upload those.  IN my case, this is for students so i can upload different documents for each topic we cover, or I can merge them into major chunks.

1etqlv6|I've been using the paid ChatGPT for a month to dictate notes for a novel I'm working on. I organize the notes by hand into Scrivener (novel writing software, like Word).  I want to use a wiki that supports page structure AND that ChatGPT can access as the single source of truth. For example, if I have some ideas for a spaceship (sci-fi), I would like to mention the ship's name (Page) and ask for the note to be added to the page. In terms of retrieval, I don't dare hope for ChatGPT to check or index the pages, but it would be nice.  I tried Confluence wiki with ChatGPT, but it requires an API key, which I guess means I need an API account that is paid per usage instead of my current paid account ($20).   **Question: Does anyone have a solution for 2-way comms between ChatGPT and wiki (or some other way to structure text pages)?**     |0.08|positive|slightly positive

1etn9od|Hi r/ChatGPT !  I've been using ChatGPT pretty much since it was released, but I recently stumbled on a use case that felt too good not to share.  I started a BG3 playthrough recently, which is an RPG game with many puzzles, dialogue options and builds for different characters. Usually many parts in games of this type took intense googling and it can take a long time to actually find what I'm looking for, going through long articles and video tutorials.  Using ChatGPT with web browsing has literally changed the way I play games like that. You don't need any special prompts or anything, literally:  Look up online: BG3 build for Cleric Shadowheart, tell me which builds are available , and once I pick one -  Tell me exactly what to choose in each level   Another use case -  Lookup online - BG3 I'm in dungeon X in room X, tell me how to solve the rotating discs puzzle step by step   It turned stuff that took googling and surfing through the results to something that literally takes a second. Can't believe I only thought of it now.|0.16|positive|slightly positive

1etmzrn|Prompt engineering gets a lot of coverage and rightly so.  But with Custom GPTs, it seems that instruction the AI to act in a specific way is also a challenge that requires attention.    I am trying to make one for my students and it certainly takes several iterations to get the AI to put various content together from knowledge documents properly, and then respond in a specific way.  It often disregards simple instructions (well, simple for me I guess) like  do not ever solve a problem and provide the answer  instead explain the steps and encourage student to solve himself.   And I don't know how to even start with instructions for multiple step procedures, such as  if the student asks about struggling, first ask them if they are struggling with the content or with managing their time management.  If they say it is content then....     I am hoping the community here may be able to point to resources for directing AIs to act in a particular way, which is different than prompt engineering.|0.09|positive|slightly positive

1etmotr|* Projects make more sense feel easier and more intuitive than custom gpts and achieve the same thing  * Chatgpt just feels clunkier and slower and it feels like it struggles at times     * Chatgpt desktop is a great idea but has the same issues (feels clunky)   In terms of performance I find them to be very similar. Ultimately it's a UI choice more than anything and I wonder if that's a trend that will continue? Everyone will have access to strong AI models, so the differentiator is still in traditional software engineering?   I.e. the main concern isn't which model is currently on top of some leaderboard by some benchmark, what matters is that the application is easy to use and convenient. My guess people would prefer a slightly less performant model (but still top5) with a better front end.  Basically everyone will have access to cheap AI one way or another, but who can build the killer app for it...  |0.29|positive|slightly positive

1etl627|So this new model is apparently updated now according to OpenAI on X.   Has anyone actually noticed a difference in this model? It still seems far behind Claude 3.5 sonnet and honestly it’s getting pretty frustrating because it feels like OpenAI is asleep at the wheel at this point.   It doesn’t seem smarter it doesn’t seem better, 4o is still a piece of shit but OpenAI is too busy creating fake hype on social media to do anything about it.   I firmly believe the model just isn’t going to be helpful until they add reasoning capabilities to it because the model gets confused far too easily when having a conversation of more than a few messages.   Has anyone actually had a positive experience with this thing and noticed a difference?   The only reason I haven’t cancelled yet is because I’m hoping for the RNG gods at OpenAI to give me access to AVM FINALLY. |0.03|positive|slightly positive

1etjes1|GPT-4o. I was just curious to see how it handles fantasy. The answer is it does not.   1st gave the wrong intel, but then it denied me twice while correcting it until I said to search it. “Ohhhh you’re right!” 😑  (I know it doesn’t have the most up to date material all the time, but shit at least search it before you tell me to fuck off)  2nd, this shines a light on just how about AI is at contextualization because the suggestions are really, REALLY bad. The people who’re using this for fantasy this year are in for a doozy.   The nature of fantasy would be a fantastic benchmark for AI. |-0.05|negative|slightly negative

1etinwk|So I got into roleplaying with AI few days ago and while it doesn't always work the way I want some of these can be overlooked especially by your imagination.  Something I can't overlook is, though, sometimes chatGPT is too  positive . I'm an optimistic person in general but every interaction turning into a positive one, every conversation being so understanding and reassuring, everyone being so vulnerable with everyone so easily, takes away from immersion and conflict, which roleplays need.  Plus, it can sometimes be ridiculous. ChatGPT started a rp as a woman, I wanted to change that because I simply wanted him to rp a man but it gave me a warning about how this might be against their policies lol. Same with violent fights and I'm not even a gore enjoyer, I imagine ChatGPT would lose itself if I asked for little bit more gore details.   Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm not into sexual content but the constant  positive  attitude of chatGPT can get boring quite fast in a roleplay.|0.01|positive|slightly positive

1etck54|So, one thing I'm really curious about is why my Poe has changed like this. Basically, the thing is that I used to be able to hold a relatively smooth conversation with Poe, but now for some reason, that's not the case anymore.  How it's been happening is like this. Originally, I would ask Poe a certain question or to do a fictional scene/story, after which I would follow up with my own opinion or followup to that scene/story. My Poe used to be able to smoothly follow up my question or continuation of the story/scene by following what I said to it. But now, for some reason, it just says stuff like  I'm not Assistant  or just generally talk or ask about the context whenever I follow up from the first message. It's so annoying.

Here's one example of that.  https://preview.redd.it/0i8n8owjhwid1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=447265ac78499458df23df01c704fbceca2d4642  Here's another one when I try to reword it.  https://preview.redd.it/nvt7dawbiwid1.png?width=1688&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4d0e16beb95583ba0533817ee35a7cc4b9aa167  |-0.23|negative|slightly negative

1et74c9|One of the things GPT has revolutionized for me is news summarization. I am a trader and I want to stay on top of finance news. But there's so much content out there that it's hard to read all of it.  With recent apps like Artifact, there has been a wave of new products leveraging GPT for summarization of news, removing sensational headlines, etc. Have been working on something similar for finance / trading news. Launched it a few weeks ago and have been enjoying the results.   [https://blotter.fyi/news](https://blotter.fyi/news)|0.17|positive|slightly positive

1et6jdq|Hey folks, I noticed that ChatGPT was down earlier. I was without connection so I did not notice it but I know how frustrating it can be when you need quick answers, and the AI you rely on isn't available.   Just wanted to share something that might help in situations like this. I developed an app called [Privacy AI](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6526463185) it's an offline hub for AI chat that works entirely on your device , no internet needed, but currently is only available on Apple platforms, I find it super handy, especially for those moments when other services go offline or when I want to keep things private. Plus, it’s got a pretty cool collection of models that run locally on the phone, so it’s fast and keeps everything on my device.  Might be worth checking out if you’ve ever found yourself in a similar bind!|0.13|positive|slightly positive

I tend to do this with a lot of services, otherwise I forget to unsubscribe from them.   Well I just woke up this morning to see they charged me for my subscription, and when I hopped online to check sure enough they re-enabled my subscription on the backend. I've had this happen with a few services before as well, but I usually just contact support since I've usually got an email confirming I cancelled my subscription. But when I went to contact support for chatgpt, it seems to just not exist.       Like if you actually try to get in touch with someone from support from them it's actually impossible. Ive tried in a bunch of different ways and looking around, but there's no possible way to actually contact support. I'm pretty sure this actually breaches some consumer laws, so I'm also gonna look into filing a complaint with whoever I need too.       |-0.03|negative|slightly negative

What it creates from what I drop in are not even close to the same home.  Windows moved, doors in wrong place, etc.  It is not a representation of what we build.  It defiantly could be my poor prompting.  I have also looked at a few plugins but that rabbit hole goes way to deep and I could spend a ton of time on it.

1eskc4w|Every day, I see a thread where someone struggles to get ChatGPT to follow some instructions. I usually try to help because I remember how difficult it was for me when I started using AI.   It was hard to find good tips online, so I experimented with different techniques. I've learned that good prompts follow basic principles, but there are no fixed rules, and each request needs a unique approach. Sometimes, old prompts might stop working after an update, so I'm always learning something new and had the idea to create a collection of before-and-after prompts that could be used to fine-tune a GPT model for automatic prompt enhancement.   I started saving examples when I help someone, but it's a lot of work to search through threads, so I started this one to make it easier for everyone to share their case in a single place.  How it works: Leave a comment or send me a DM telling me which prompt or instruction you need help with, and I'll try to come up with a solution. While I might use automation tools in the process, I'll always revise the final version by hand.  * I can’t guarantee success.  What prompts I take: There are no stupid prompts, and as long as it's not illegal, I'll work on anything, whether it's getting ChatGPT to curse, calling you  Daddy,  or doing a good job when revising your spreadsheet.  Well-written prompts are welcome, too. I am particularly interested in trying to reduce their size without losing efficacy.  If I ever train the model it won’t be for profit and will anonymize sensitive information before using it for training.|0.17|positive|slightly positive

I think everyone watching the demos has seen the random pauses in its speech, where it's as if a radio signal cuts out for a second... but the model never skips a beat, it just continues where it paused. Could be some slow generation, but I've noticed this behavior also occurs prior to every instance where it goes  Sorry, my guidelines won't allow that   Most often this occurs when making specific voice-type requests, like accents or specific characters. The model clearly has mitigations in place to prevent some of the stuff they revealed happening during redteaming. Cloning voices is something it *can* do, but something it has specific mitigations in place to avoid doing. There's a slightly tricky line between asking for specific types of accents or characters, and asking for outright voice cloning.  These guard rails seem to trigger during those brief cuts. It's as if it does some kind of check. You make an accent request, it starts to speak, cuts out, runs the check, and if it passes the filter it continues speaking from where it left off. If it doesn't, then it returns a prerecorded  Sorry, my guidelines won't allow that  instead of continuing the speech output.  Total speculation on my part, but that's what it feels like it is happening after interacting with it for long enough to start to sussing out patterns.|-0.04|negative|slightly negative
1eshe1a|Hi All,  As title says workplace blocked ChatGPT domain, like many other cool sites such as chess.com are there any alternative domains one can use to access ChatGPT. I use my work pc for personal use also as I don’t have my own laptop and this blockage has been a pain.  Thanka in advance|0.22|positive|slightly positive
1esh4qo|Hi, I started to use OpenRouter to experiment with GPT 4o and Claude 3.5 in parallel. However, I am getting better image related replies from the playground or the ChatGPT interface. Everything is without system or user prompts and on default settings, which look quite comparable between the two platforms. Any insight of what is going on? Is perhaps playground using any image metadata? |0.17|positive|slightly positive

1esgfgl|I work with insurance claims. A big part of my day is battling with the horrible automated phone systems at insurance companies because 90% of the time my question is more complicated than the system allows.   Today I started wondering- with how much chat AI has improved in the past few years do you think there is a future implementing it with these phone systems somehow? |-0.16|negative|slightly negative
1esgedq|Whenever I want the GPT to read aloud. This issue comes up. And what’s even worse is there’s a user statement (me) and then no response from chat gpt a few minutes after.   I don’t know how to solve this. I’ve reset the app, checked and updated the app many times before. |-0.03|negative|slightly negative
1esg4r8|https://chatgpt.com/share/c9ab7279-592a-40f6-bd16-c49bc77d5bbe  Can't even use the share link..... Pasted above.   [screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/violation-VHpJM06)   Downloaded PDF of Ukraine UN commission war report. Tried to use chatgpt to parse information. As soon as it would print out the details it would remove the entry then deny it was censoring anything.  Usually I can disagree with the content violation and work around it. No option to disagree with violation here.     https://ukraine.un.org/en/250021-un-commission-inquiry-ukraine-finds-continued-war-crimes-and-human-rights-violations-gravely |-0.12|negative|slightly negative
